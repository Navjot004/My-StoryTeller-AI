The old temple in Ayodhya was quiet. Pandit Sharmaji was worried. The Hanuman idol, usually gleaming with devotion, was dull. Even worse, Hanuman’s gada, the heavy mace he always held, was GONE! Sharmaji knew something was terribly wrong. Hanuman, the immortal devotee of Ram, was connected to this gada. It was part of his power. That night, a young boy, Rohan, saw a shadow slip from the temple. He told Sharmaji. Together, they followed the faint scent of sandalwood and marigold, leading them through the narrow lanes of the old city. The scent stopped at a crumbling house, belonging to a reclusive old woman called Daadi. Sharmaji knew Daadi collected old things. Could she have taken the gada? He knocked. Daadi, frail but sharp-eyed, opened the door. “Panditji! What brings you here?” Sharmaji explained about the missing gada. Daadi chuckled. "Come in," she said, leading them to a dusty room. In the corner, wrapped in an old shawl, was the gada! "I found it near the river," Daadi said. "It felt… powerful. I thought it needed to be safe." Sharmaji looked closely at the gada. He noticed a small, almost invisible scratch on the handle. He knew then. This wasn't just theft. Someone was trying to weaken Hanuman, to break the protection over Ayodhya. He took the gada. "Thank you, Daadi. You may have saved us all." Back at the temple, as Sharmaji placed the gada back in Hanuman's hand, the idol seemed to glow brighter. The mystery wasn't solved, but one thing was clear: someone had a dark purpose, and they would have to be stopped. The search for answers had only just begun.
