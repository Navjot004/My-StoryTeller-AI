Kira, a notorious artifact thief, targeted the Museum of Xantus. Her goal: The Shifting Sarcophagus, said to contain a mummy with strange powers. Inside, wrapped in shimmering bandages, was not dust, but Xylar, a being from a long-dead star system. As Kira touched the sarcophagus, Xylar awoke. He wasn't angry, but curious. He communicated through images in her mind, showing dying stars and lost civilizations. Kira, usually cold, felt a pang of sympathy. Security alarms blared. Kira, instead of running, helped Xylar out of his tomb. He was weak, disoriented. Using a stolen hoverbike, she flew them out, the city lights blurring below. "Where now?" she mentally asked Xylar. He showed her a distant nebula, a faint echo of home. Kira grinned. "Guess we're going star-hopping," she thought. The thief and the mummy, unlikely partners, heading towards the unknown.rse in his head. The mummy smiled, its purpose fulfilled.
