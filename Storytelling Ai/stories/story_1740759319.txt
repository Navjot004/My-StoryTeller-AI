The flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows in the dusty museum basement. Jack, a thief with more guts than brains, grinned. Tonight was the night. He'd been planning this for months. The prize: the Eye of Ra, a jewel said to be worth more than any king's ransom, buried with the ancient mummy of Pharaoh Akhenaten. He picked the lock on the sarcophagus room with practiced ease. Inside, the air was thick and dry, smelling of old linen and something else... something like dust and forgotten dreams. Akhenaten's sarcophagus, a massive stone box, sat in the center, bathed in the dim light. Jack pulled out his crowbar. "Easy peasy," he muttered. With a grunt, he pried the heavy lid open. Inside lay the mummy, wrapped in layers of linen bandages. Resting on its chest, gleaming even in the low light, was the Eye of Ra. "Bingo!" Jack reached for it, his fingers brushing the cool, smooth surface. Suddenly, the ground trembled. Dust rained down from the ceiling. The bandages around the mummy began to twitch. Jack froze, his blood turning to ice. With a slow, groaning sound, the mummy sat up. Its eyes, hollow and dark, fixed on Jack. Jack yelped and stumbled backward, dropping the crowbar. He scrambled to his feet, his heart hammering against his ribs. "Okay, okay, maybe I should go," he stammered, his voice shaking. The mummy didn't answer. It rose to its full height, towering over Jack. Its ancient eyes burned with an unholy light. Panic surged through Jack. He turned and ran, the sound of his footsteps echoing in the silent basement. He glanced back. The mummy was lumbering after him, its movements slow but relentless. Jack burst out of the sarcophagus room and into the main basement corridor. He ran blindly, dodging crates and shelves. The mummy was gaining on him. He could hear its heavy, shuffling footsteps behind him. He ducked behind a stack of old pottery. Peeking out, he saw the mummy round the corner. It stopped, its head swiveling, searching. Jack had to think fast. He spotted a small, open window near the ceiling. It was a long shot, but it was his only chance. He grabbed a nearby ladder and quickly climbed up, his hands shaking. He squeezed through the window, landing with a thud on the other side, in a small alley behind the museum. He didn't stop to catch his breath. He ran, faster than he had ever run before, until he was blocks away from the museum. He collapsed against a wall, gasping for air. "I am never," he wheezed, "ever stealing anything from a mummy again." He spent the next few weeks lying low, haunted by the image of the ancient mummy's eyes. He knew he had messed with something he didn't understand. He regretted his greed, his recklessness. One day, he saw a news report on TV. The museum was abuzz. Apparently, a valuable artifact, the Eye of Ra, had been returned to its rightful place on the Pharaoh's chest. No one knew how it got there. Jack shook his head. He knew. He decided to change his ways. He got a job as a night watchman at a local warehouse. It wasn't glamorous, but it was honest. He promised himself he'd stay away from anything ancient and anything valuable. One night, a few months later, while making his rounds, he heard a strange noise coming from the storage room. Cautiously, he opened the door. Inside, sitting on top of a stack of boxes, was a small, mummified cat. It blinked its ancient eyes at him. Jack swallowed hard. "Okay," he said, his voice trembling. "Maybe I should just go." He backed away slowly, closing the door behind him. He knew, deep down, that his adventures weren't over yet. The past, it seemed, had a way of catching up, even to a reformed thief like Jack. And he had a feeling this time, it was going to be purr-fectly terrifying.
