Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Cairo Museum. Inside, shadows danced, making the ancient exhibits seem to shift and whisper. For Danny “Fingers” Malone, a thief with a reputation as slippery as an eel, it was perfect. Tonight, Fingers wasn’t after gold or jewels. He wanted the Eye of Ra, a legendary ruby said to hold unimaginable power, buried with the mummy of Pharaoh Akhenaten IV. Security was tight, but Fingers had studied the blueprints for weeks. He knew the blind spots, the camera angles, and the guard rotations like the back of his hand. He slipped through a side window, the glass cutter working silently. The museum's main hall loomed before him, filled with towering statues and sarcophagi. He crept past them, his heart pounding like a drum solo. The Hall of Pharaohs was his target. Akhenaten's sarcophagus rested on a raised platform, surrounded by laser beams and pressure plates. Fingers grinned. Child's play. He used a small mirror to identify the laser grid and then, with practiced ease, slid between the beams, his body contorting like a rubber band. The pressure plates were next. He remembered the pattern from the blueprints: step on the second tile, then the fifth, then the last. He hopped across them, light as a feather. He stood before the sarcophagus, the air thick with the scent of dust and something else… something ancient and unsettling. He pulled out a small crowbar and gently pried open the heavy lid. Inside, wrapped in linen bandages, lay Akhenaten. His skin was leathery and dark, his face surprisingly peaceful. Around his neck, nestled amongst layers of cloth, was the Eye of Ra. It pulsed with a warm, red light. Fingers reached for it. As his fingers brushed against the ruby, the room temperature plummeted. A gust of wind extinguished his flashlight, plunging him into darkness. He fumbled for the ruby, but something grabbed his wrist. He gasped. The mummy’s hand! Its grip was surprisingly strong, like cold, hard stone. "Looking for something?" a raspy voice echoed in the hall. Akhenaten was sitting up, his eyes glowing with the same red light as the Eye of Ra. Fingers scrambled backward, banging against the side of the sarcophagus. "I… I didn't mean any harm," Fingers stammered, his bravado gone. Akhenaten chuckled, a dry, unsettling sound. "Harm? You dare disturb the rest of a pharaoh for a trinket?" Fingers didn’t wait for an answer. He spun around and bolted, dodging the outstretched hand of the mummy. He flew past the pressure plates, ignoring the pattern, triggering the alarm. The museum erupted in noise. Sirens wailed, lights flashed, and guards shouted. Fingers didn't stop. He scrambled back through the laser grid, relying on pure luck and adrenaline. He burst out of the side window he’d entered through, landing in the pouring rain. He ran, his lungs burning, the sound of the alarm ringing in his ears. He didn't stop running until he reached his hideout, a small, dingy apartment above a Cairo market. He slammed the door shut, locking it with a trembling hand. He sat on the edge of his bed, catching his breath. He was safe. For now. But he couldn't shake the image of Akhenaten’s glowing eyes, the feel of his cold grip. He reached into his pocket, expecting to find the Eye of Ra. His hand came up empty. He had gotten away, but he hadn't gotten what he came for. Suddenly, the room grew cold. The single bulb flickered, casting long, dancing shadows. He felt a presence behind him. He slowly turned around. Akhenaten stood there, his eyes still glowing. He hadn't moved, hadn’t spoken, but there was an air of quiet strength around him. Fingers gulped. “How… how did you find me?” Akhenaten tilted his head, a slight smile playing on his lips. “The Eye of Ra allows me to see… those who seek it.” He held out his hand. In his palm, the ruby pulsed with an even brighter light. “You sought power, little thief. But power comes with responsibility. The Eye of Ra is not a trinket to be stolen. It is a protector, a guardian. It must be returned.” Fingers stared at the ruby, then back at Akhenaten. He knew he couldn't argue. He was outmatched, outgunned, and, frankly, scared stiff. He nodded slowly. "Okay," he said, his voice barely a whisper. Akhenaten smiled, a real smile this time, and it was surprisingly kind. He gently placed the Eye of Ra back around his neck. The room warmed, the shadows receded, and the normal smell of the market filled the air. "You have learned a valuable lesson, Fingers Malone," Akhenaten said. "Some things are best left undisturbed." Then, just as quickly as he had appeared, Akhenaten vanished. Fingers slumped back onto his bed, his heart still pounding. He stayed awake the rest of the night, listening to the rain and thinking about what he had learned. The next morning, he went back to the museum. He found a guard and confessed everything. He was arrested, of course, but he didn't resist. He served his time. When he got out, he didn't go back to thieving. The memory of Akhenaten and the Eye of Ra was enough to keep him honest. He got a job as a night watchman, ironically enough. He spent his nights walking the empty halls, a silent guardian, a thief who had learned his lesson. He never again sought what wasn't his. He understood that some things are better left undisturbed, ancient secrets best left to sleep in the shadows.
