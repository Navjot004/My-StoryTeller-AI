Raffy the thief was good at his job. He heard about a lost tomb, filled with gold and guarded by an ancient mummy. He couldn't resist. He found the tomb hidden deep in the desert. Inside, it was dark and dusty. Gold glittered everywhere! Raffy started stuffing his bag. Suddenly, the ground shook. A tall, wrapped figure rose. The mummy! It groaned and shuffled towards Raffy. Raffy was scared, but he had a trick. He threw a handful of sand at the mummy's face. The mummy coughed, distracted. Raffy grabbed one last golden statue and ran. He didn't look back. He could hear the mummy's angry groans fading behind him. Raffy escaped the tomb, richer but also very, very spooked. He decided maybe stealing wasn't worth it.
